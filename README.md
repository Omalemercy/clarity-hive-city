# HiveCity

A decentralized urban planning metaverse built on Stacks blockchain.

## Overview
HiveCity allows users to collaboratively plan and build virtual cities using NFT-based land parcels and structures. The platform implements decentralized governance mechanisms for urban development decisions.

## Features
- Land parcel NFTs with coordinates and zoning attributes
- Building/structure NFTs that can be placed on owned land
- Governance system for zoning and development proposals
- Resource management for city infrastructure
- Staking mechanism for governance participation
- Weighted voting based on staked amounts
- Rewards for active participation in governance

## Staking and Governance
Users can stake tokens to participate in governance decisions. The voting power is proportional to the staked amount, ensuring that those with more stake in the city have greater influence over its development. Staking also earns rewards based on participation in governance activities.

### Minimum Requirements
- Minimum stake: 100 tokens
- Proposal voting period: 144 blocks (~24 hours)
- Reward rate: 5 tokens per block staked
